        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I've been fascinated with technology ever since I was a small child. My parents, both Software Engineers,
            passed on their love for technology to me.
            At the age of 9, I set up my own server using basic networking and code, sparking a lifelong passion for
            computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond technology, I've been a <em>Taekwondo</em> master since 2018, teaching others and honing my
            leadership skills.
            When I'm not working on software, you can find me practicing martial arts or exploring the latest video game
            releases.
