            This experience has thought me skills such as Agile Development methodologies, 
            working with <em>React</em> and <em>TypeScript</em> development tools, 
            and collaborating within a team environment.

            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I've been fascinated with technology ever since I was a small child.
            My parents both come from a Software Engineering background and their love for technology was passed onto me.
            I often tinkered with video games, my favorite past-time, learning and discovering how they were made and how I could make my own.
            At the age of 9, I finally figured out how to host my own server using basic networking and code. 
            Since then, my love for computers and technology has only grown exponentially. 
            I've also been a <em>Taekwondo</em> master since 2018, 
            a role that has granted me the wonderful experience of working with and being able to teach others.
